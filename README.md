# learning-rust

> To check my actual projects, please see my other repositories.

This repository documents my journey to becoming a Rust developer. It includes practical examples from **Rust by Example**, hands-on exercises from **Rustlings**, and detailed code and notes from *The Rust Programming Language* book. Everything here is based on official Rust resources; this repo is intended to **showcase my progress in learning Rust**.

## Folders

This repository contains my Rust learning journey:

- `rust_by_example/` – Exercises from Rust by Example  
  > Each example is a small, standalone Rust program, often starting with its own `fn main()`. These files are meant for practice and are not combined into a single project. 
- `rust_programming_language/` – Notes and examples from *The Rust Programming Language* book  
- `rustlings/` – Hands-on exercises from the Rustlings course  

Each folder contains exercises and small code snippets to practice Rust syntax and concepts.
